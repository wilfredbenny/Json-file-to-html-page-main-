## CORS Policy issue
Access to XMLHttpRequest at '{dir}/1.json' from origin 'null' has been blocked by 
CORS policy: Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, chrome-untrusted, https, isolated-app.

# Resolution

#### 1. Open VS Code and install live server extension published by Ritwick Dey
![Extension](https://github.com/wilfredbenny/Json-file-to-html-page-main-/blob/main/Assets/Extension.png)
#### 2. Launch html file by context menu option - Open with Live Server
